                   As a high school student, I have always been fascinated by the dynamic interplay between technology and art. 
                    I find myself drawn to the intersection where these two fields meet, where the boundaries between creativity 
                    and innovation blur and the possibilities seem endless. Whether it's experimenting with the latest digital art
                    tools, delving into the nuances of programming and software development, or exploring the fascinating world of 
                    virtual and augmented reality, I am constantly on the lookout for new ways to expand my knowledge and skills in 
                    this rapidly evolving field. With each new project, I am inspired by the endless potential of technology to enhance
                    and transform the ways in which we express ourselves and engage with the world around us, and I am excited to see 
                    where this passion for technology and art will take me in the future..

            <p> I was introduced to coding through extracurricular classes. It was in these classes that I first 
                discovered my passion for programming and began to explore. As I continued to develop my skills and knowledge, 
                I found myself more and more engrossed in the challenges and opportunities presented by coding. This experience 
                sparked a deep interest in computer science, leading me to continue to explore new possibilities and push the boundaries
                of what is possible through programming.</p>

                <p> Since childhood, I've been passionate about video editing, inspired by Marvel and Avatar films. 
                    I worked hard to develop my skills and create my own visual effects. Joining my school's editing 
                    team allowed me to collaborate with others and grow even further. Today, I'm still captivated by 
                    visual storytelling and constantly push the limits in video editing.</p>

                <p> Doodling has been a go-to source of comfort and self-expression for me. It's a simple yet powerful way 
                    to channel my thoughts and emotions onto paper, helping me to calm my mind and regain focus. sharing my
                    doodles with others has allowed me to inspire and connect with like-minded creatives, encouraging them to 
                    embrace their own unique talents and perspectives.
